# Facebook-is-not-Wikipedia 

On my talk page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Neel.arunabh,
there is a message by SpacemanSpiff saying "Random emailing of admins,
random pinging, and once email access has been removed, you've even
started sending random Facebook friend requests!" I just wanted to
point out that I do not send random Facebook friend requests. Facebook
is not Wikipedia. I need to connect with people on social networks,
especially people whom I know in real life. It has nothing to do with
Wikipedia.
